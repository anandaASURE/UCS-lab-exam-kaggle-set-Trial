# UCS Kaggle 654 Lab Exam 1 - Solution

## Overview
This repository contains my solution to the **UCS Kaggle 654 Lab Exam 1 Set**. The problem involves applying data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and model the given dataset effectively. The objective is to develop an accurate predictive model using appropriate preprocessing, feature engineering, and algorithm selection.

## Dataset
The dataset provided in the lab exam consists of multiple features, which were analyzed and preprocessed before training the model. The dataset details include:
- Number of features: *[Specify number]*
- Number of samples: *[Specify number]*
- Target variable: *[Specify name]*

## Solution Approach
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using *[technique used, e.g., mean imputation, median replacement]*.
- Encoded categorical variables using *[One-Hot Encoding / Label Encoding]*.
- Scaled numerical features using *[StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler]*.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions and relationships.
- Identified and removed outliers if necessary.
- Checked feature correlations and selected relevant variables.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new features based on domain insights.
- Performed dimensionality reduction if applicable.

### 4. Model Selection & Training
- Evaluated multiple models including:
  - *[List models used, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost]*
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.
- Used cross-validation to assess model performance.

### 5. Performance Metrics
- The final model was evaluated using:
  - Accuracy: *[Value]*
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score: *[Values]*
  - ROC-AUC Score: *[Value]*

## Results & Insights
- The best-performing model was *[model name]* with an accuracy of *[score]*.
- Key findings from the dataset:
  - *[Insight 1]*
  - *[Insight 2]*

## Dependencies
To run this solution, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Required Libraries
- Python 3.x
