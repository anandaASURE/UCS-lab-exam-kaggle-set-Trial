# UCS Kaggle 654 Lab Exam 1 - Solution

## Overview
This repository contains my solution to the **UCS Kaggle 654 Lab Exam 1 Set**. The problem involves applying data science and machine learning techniques to analyze and model the given dataset effectively. The objective is to develop an accurate predictive model using appropriate preprocessing, feature engineering, and algorithm selection.

## Dataset
The dataset provided in the lab exam consists of multiple features, which were analyzed and preprocessed before training the model. The dataset details include:
- Number of features: 6
- Number of samples: spedified in csv
- Target variable: target named column

## Solution Approach
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical variables using  Label Encoding
- Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler 

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions and relationships.
- Identified and removed outliers if necessary.
- Checked feature correlations and selected relevant variables.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Created new features based on domain insights.
- Performed dimensionality reduction if applicable.

### 4. Model Selection & Training
- Evaluated multiple models including:
  -  XGBoost
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV.
- Used cross-validation to assess model performance.

### 5. Performance Metrics
- The final model was evaluated using:
  - Accuracy: specified in notebook



### Required Libraries
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- XGBoost / LightGBM (if applicable)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/ucs-kaggle-654-lab-exam.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ucs-kaggle-654-lab-exam
   ```
# Now Run notebook

## Future Improvements
- Improve feature selection using advanced techniques like SHAP values.
- Experiment with deep learning models if applicable.
- Optimize hyperparameter tuning using Bayesian Optimization.
